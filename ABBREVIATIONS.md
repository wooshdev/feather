# Abbreviations
This project uses a lot of abbreviations throughout the code. This is because C doesn't support
hierarchy with namespaces, as with languages like C++. Some abbreviations may seem vague or 
ambiguous, and therefore the following table exists.

Abbreviation | Meaning
----|-
CS  | Core Server/Service
FC  | File Cache
GS  | Global State
IO  | File (Descriptor) related stuff
OM  | Options Manager
OMS | Security-related Options (Manager)
SM  | Statistics Manager
RS  | Redirection Server/Service
